The Inverted Search Project creates an inverted index using data structures like hash tables or linked lists to map words to their occurrences across documents. 
This enables efficient and fast retrieval of documents based on search queries. 
The project demonstrates the practical application of data structures for building search engines, focusing on speed and accuracy. 
It supports quick lookups for specific terms and their locations. 
This technique is widely used in search engines and text retrieval systems.
